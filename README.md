# Employee Attrition Analysis - Final Project

## Project Description

This project is an in-depth analysis of employee data to understand the factors influencing **employee attrition** within a company. We leverage a rich dataset containing demographic and employment details such as department, job role, monthly income, performance rating, job satisfaction, years at company, and more. Through this project, we aim to uncover actionable insights and patterns that can help reduce attrition and improve workforce stability.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Attrition Rate**: Percentage of employees leaving the organization.
- **Average Monthly Income by Role/Department**: Identifies disparities impacting attrition.
- **Job Satisfaction & Work-Life Balance Scores**: Measures of employee contentment.
- **Average Tenure (Years at Company/Role/Manager)**: Insights on longevity and stability.
- **Performance Rating vs. Attrition**: Relationship between high/low performers and their likelihood to leave.

## Interesting Insights

- **OverTime & Attrition**: Employees working overtime are significantly more likely to leave.
- **Job Role Influence**: Certain roles such as Sales Representative and Laboratory Technician showed higher attrition than others like Research Director or Manager.
- **Work-Life Balance & Job Satisfaction**: Employees with lower scores in these areas showed much higher attrition rates.
- **Monthly Income Correlation**: Employees at the lower end of the salary scale tended to leave more often, suggesting compensation may be a retention lever.
- **Departmental Trends**: The Sales and Research & Development departments had the highest turnover, while others were more stable.
