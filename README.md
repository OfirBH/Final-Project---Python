# Employee Attrition Analysis - Final Project

## Project Description

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of employee data to uncover the key factors that impact **employee attrition** within an organization. Utilizing a robust dataset that includes demographic information, employment details (such as department, job role, monthly income, performance rating, job satisfaction, tenure, and more), we explore both quantitative and qualitative aspects affecting attrition. 

To visually present our findings, we incorporate a series of engaging and informative figures, charts, and advanced visualizations (e.g., interactive dashboards, heatmaps, and infographics) throughout this report. These visual elements not only illustrate important trends—like the relationship between overtime and attrition, income disparity, and job satisfaction—but also make the insights immediately accessible and appealing to stakeholders.

By blending statistical analysis with impactful visual storytelling, this project delivers actionable insights and highlights concrete patterns that leaders can leverage to reduce employee turnover and enhance workforce stability.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Attrition Rate**: Percentage of employees leaving the organization.
- **Average Monthly Income by Role/Department**: Identifies disparities impacting attrition.
- **Job Satisfaction & Work-Life Balance Scores**: Measures of employee contentment.
- **Average Tenure (Years at Company/Role/Manager)**: Insights on longevity and stability.
- **Performance Rating vs. Attrition**: Relationship between high/low performers and their likelihood to leave.

## Interesting Insights

- **OverTime & Attrition**: Employees working overtime are significantly more likely to leave.
- **Job Role Influence**: Certain roles such as Sales Representative and Laboratory Technician showed higher attrition than others like Research Director or Manager.
- **Work-Life Balance & Job Satisfaction**: Employees with lower scores in these areas showed much higher attrition rates.
- **Monthly Income Correlation**: Employees at the lower end of the salary scale tended to leave more often, suggesting compensation may be a retention lever.
- **Departmental Trends**: The Sales and Research & Development departments had the highest turnover, while others were more stable.

## Conclusions

- **OverTime and Low Work-Life Balance are strong predictors of attrition.**
- **Departments and roles with high turnover should be focus areas for retention efforts.**
- **Compensation, career growth opportunities, and regular satisfaction surveys are crucial to understanding and mitigating attrition.**

- **Enhance Job Satisfaction:** Provide opportunities for advancement and recognize high performance.
- **Adjust Compensation:** Review salary structures for roles/departments with higher attrition.
- **Empower Managers:** Invest in manager training to improve relationships with staff.
- **Regular Monitoring:** Implement ongoing analytics dashboards to monitor KPIs and act quickly when risks rise.
